ðŸ”¹ 1. Operators
1.1 Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform mathematical calculations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus (remainder), and exponentiation (power).

1.2 Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables. They can also combine assignment with arithmetic (e.g., += means add and assign).

1.3 Comparison Operators

Used to compare two values. They return true or false.
Example checks: equal, strictly equal (value + type), not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal, less than or equal.

1.4 Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions:

&& â†’ AND (all conditions must be true).

|| â†’ OR (at least one condition true).

! â†’ NOT (reverses true/false).

1.5 Ternary Operator

A short way of writing if...else in a single line.

1.6 Bitwise Operators

Work on binary (0s and 1s). Examples include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), right shift (>>).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Conditionals
2.1 if...else if...else

Executes different blocks of code depending on whether conditions are true or false.

2.2 switch Statement

Checks a single value against multiple possible cases. It is cleaner than writing many if...else if statements.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Loops
3.1 for Loop

Repeats code a fixed number of times. Best when the number of repetitions is known.

3.2 while Loop

Repeats code as long as a condition remains true. Best when you donâ€™t know how many times the loop should run.

3.3 do...while Loop

Similar to while loop, but guarantees at least one execution before checking the condition.

3.4 for...of Loop

Used to iterate over arrays, strings, or iterable objects. Gives values directly.

3.5 for...in Loop

Used to iterate over the keys (properties) of an object.
